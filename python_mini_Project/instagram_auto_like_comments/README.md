# There are two different versions
1) using BeautifulSoup & selenium 
2) just Selenium 

But, as a result, I decided to use just Selenium for automating, 
due to a structure of Instagram. 
If you utilise the BeautifulSoup, you would face some scroll problem, I mean, you could control about scroll height, 
however, the process of crawling couldn't make me feel happy. It wasn't quite smooth when it comes to working on Instagram.
Thus, eventually, you would face some problems.

Due to the this reason, I would like to say that Using just Selenium would much better for this.
